A mind-bending puzzle-platformer of survival, deception, and time.

**daemon cat 1x6x9** is a puzzle–escape game built with [Kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/).  

You play as a numbered subject in a cruel AGI’s experiment — trapped in a series of five shifting chambers, each designed to twist your instincts against you. The walls themselves heat up with time, forcing you to think fast, but cleverness alone may not be enough.  

Survive the chambers. Beat the machine. Or refuse the game.

### Features
- A browser-based 2D puzzle experience 
- Five chambers with unique mechanics (timer-heat, traps, vertical climbs, false exits)  
- Minimalist aesthetic: glowing white geometry, heat-based tension  
- Psychological twist: the real escape may not be what it seems  

### Development

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/stroyoes/daemon_cat_1x6x9.git
cd daemon-cat-1x6x9
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```sh
npm install
```

3. **Start the development server**

```sh
npm run dev
```

Vite will start a local dev server and show output like:
```sh
Local:   http://localhost:5173/
Network: http://192.168.x.x:5173/

```

4. **Open the game in your browser**

Navigate to **http://localhost:5173**

#### Building for production

Use `npm` to create an optimized build:

```sh
npm run build
```

This generates the final output in the `dist/` directory.

To preview the production build locally:
```sh
npm run preview
```

This serves the build so you can test it before deploying.
